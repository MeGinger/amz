给一个list的数字stream。都是sorted的。然后返回排序好的stream。
比如
1, 5, 6, 7
2, 3, 9
4, 11, 21

->> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 21....
sort stream pq twice. -- find medium

insertion sort??
class Solution{
  public void insertionSort(List<Integer> nums, int newInt){
    int j = nums.size() - 1;
    nums.add(newInt);
    while(j >= 0 && nums.get(j) > newInt){
      nums.set(j + 1, nums.get(j));
      j--;
    }
    nums.set(j + 1, newInt);
  }
}

1.给一个未排序数组 值为1-N， 给一个交换索引的function，把数组排序。followup：要求不用任何memory，只用判断和给出的交换索引的function.(判断function是什么？)
2.给一个数组，给一个目标integer. 找出数组中所有相加等于目标integer的pair --two sum？？？ really？？


1. find Kth smallest element in an array --need to check
2. convert sorted array to BST-- binary search need to check edge case

* *customer obession*
1.Solve production issue, user screen record.
2.
* *ownership*
When I build the access control, provide the document for the team.
Build automation test for xTrain module
* invent and simplify
* *are right, a lot*

* hire and develop the best
* *insist on high standards*
* *think big*
* bias for action
* *frugality*
* vocally self critical
* *earn trust of others*
Production support ticket.
* *dive deep*

* *have backbone; disgree and commit*
* *deliver results*
There is a sprint we need to build the access control for the xtrain module, because it was a huge task,
so it was initially assigned to two team members to finish, me and another software engineer, 
but unfortuanately my other member has to leave our company due to her personal issues, so I was the only one
who is in charge of the whole task.
I know it is a very huge task for me and I need to figure out the business requirement first. So I did the planning
for the task carefully at the beginning. Firstly we had a meeting with our business anylyst and Product Owner to figure out
the requirement for each role. Then before I start coding, I spent some time summarize the group of the roles which have the similar privileges
, for that sprint, i was really super efficient working on this ticket, and I added the access control one by one. And inorder to let the testers
finish do the testing, i seperate the whole effort into two, deploy the termination related flows first to let the tester test, and deploy 
the appointment related flows later.Finally we are able to make it for the planned production release date, I got some kudos from the team
and did not lose the trust from the customers.

negative feedback from tech lead.

There was a sprint, our product owner created a story want us to check where we are using the primary_odg_id in our application, and my 
tech lead assign this story to me. I did the analysis accoss the whole application and wrote the report and mention the classes and query we are 
using that field, but at the end of the sprint, I asked my tech lead review the report, she told me that the my report can only be understand 
by software developers however the product owner will not understand it when they review it. She think i did not figure out the real purpose 
of the ticket when I start to do it. So I did transfer my report to english sentances to describe the situation to let PO better understand
my word. After this I really appreciate my tech lead's opoinion and I have learned that I should be very clear of the requirement and start my work, otherwise 
enven you put lots of the effort you may not satisfy the requirement.

I do recommend that you have two for customer obsession, two for ownership, 
and then two for principles that relate to the job you want.


1.Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions. What was the problem and how did you determine the course of action? 
What was the outcome of that choice?

2.When have you ever taken a risk, made a mistake or failed? How did you respond and how did you learn from that experience?
migration 已有的用户在用，为了让输出更好，改API，问用户 research， almost everyone 支持。 take ownership， earn trust
3.Describe a time when you took the lead on a project
4.What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals or encourage collaboration during a particular project?
5.How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?
